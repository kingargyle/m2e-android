#Building

Before you start you need to:

 * Install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
 * Create `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable containing the Android SDK install path. 
 * Ensure you have updated the Android SDK (execute `android update sdk --no-ui --obsolete --force`).
 * Install the latest [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html) for command line [Tycho](http://tycho.sonatype.org/) support.
 * Install the [Maven Android SDK Deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer).

To build execute the following command from the project folder:

```
$ mvn install
```
 
###Eclipse Set-up

To configure your development environment please follow these steps:

 * Install [Eclipse Luna](http://eclipse.org/downloads).
 * Install latest [Android Development Tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html).
 * Install [Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment.](http://www.eclipse.org/pde/).
 * In Eclipse select _Help -> Install new software..._ and go to the _Maven Eclipse_ update site.
 * Un-check the _Group items by category_ check box.
 * You should now see the "m2e - Extensions Development Support (Optional)" plugin.
 * Select, install and restart Eclipse.

This project consists of several sub-modules, including:

 * Parent POM.
 * Core Eclipse plugin.
 * Test suite.
 * Eclipse feature.
 * Various [target definitions](https://wiki.eclipse.org/PDE/Target_Definitions).
 * and the update site.

To clone them into your Eclipse workspace follow these steps: 

 * Clone this git repository into your local workspace.
 * In Eclipse select _File_ -> _Import..._ in the menu and then select _Maven_ -> _Existing Maven Projects_.
 * Choose the parent folder you just cloned into your workspace (should be _m2e-android_), select all sub projects and click _Finish_
 * If you get a _"Plugin exception not covered by lifecycle configuration"_ error, click _"Discover new m2e connectors."_ This will allow you to install the Tycho configurator.
 * Mark all new projects in the _Package Explorer_ and right-click on them to select _Team_ -> _Share Project_.
 * Select _Git_ and click _Next_.
 * Check the _Use or create Repository in parent folder of project_ and click _Finish_.
